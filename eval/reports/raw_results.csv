(See Annex I: Glossary) Section 2: Current Status and Trends 2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2010-201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C', 'spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 {WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10} 65 For 1850-1900 to 2013-2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850-1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 66 The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010-2019 is 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WGI SPM footnote 11} 67 Contributions from emissions to the 2010-2019 warming relative to 1850-1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. 68 For 2021 (the most recent year for which final numbers are available) concentrations using the same observational', '70 Section 3 Section 1 Section 3 2011-2020 was around 1.1°C warmer than 1850-1900 the last time global surface temperature was sustained at or above 2.5°C was over 3 million years ago 4°C The world at 2°C The world at 1.5°C + + 1 0 The world at 3°C The world at small absolute changes may appear large as % or σ changes in dry regions urbanisation further intensifies heat extremes c) Annual wettest-day precipitation change Global warming level (GWL) above 1850-1900 a) Annual hottest-day temperature change b) Annual mean total column soil moisture change °C Annual wettest day precipitation is projected to increase in almost all continental regions, even in regions where projected annual mean soil moisture declines. Annual hottest day temperature is projected to increase most (1.5-2 times the GWL) in some mid-latitude and semi-arid regions, and in the South American Monsoon region.

This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850-1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850-1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade.

Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1', 'm between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to -4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, WGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2} Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",8,99014,By how much did global surface temperature increase in 2011–2020 vs 1850–1900?,"['63 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.

The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.

It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence).

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.8793374218447346,0.7192711184010576,1.0,False
Is the observed warming mainly caused by human activities?,"Sim, o aquecimento observado é causado por atividades humanas [p.8]. É inequívoco que a influência humana aqueceu a atmosfera, o oceano e a terra [p.12]. As atividades humanas, principalmente através das emissões de gases de efeito estufa, causaram inequivocamente o aquecimento global, com a temperatura de superfície global atingindo 1,1°C acima de 1850-1900 em 2011-2020 [p.8].

Estudos formais de detecção e atribuição mostram que a melhor estimativa é que todo o aquecimento observado entre 1850-1900 e 2010-2019 é causado por humanos [p.9]. O intervalo provável do aumento total da temperatura de superfície global causado por humanos de 1850-1900 a 2010-2019 é de 0,8°C a 1,3°C, com uma melhor estimativa de 1,07°C [p.8].

A contribuição dos diferentes fatores para o aquecimento é a seguinte:
* **Gases de Efeito Estufa (GEE) bem misturados:** Contribuíram com um aquecimento provável de 1,0°C a 2,0°C [p.8]. Os aumentos observados nas concentrações de GEE bem misturados desde cerca de 1750 são inequivocamente causados por emissões de GEE de atividades humanas [p.8].
* **Outros fatores humanos:** Contribuíram com um resfriamento de 0,0°C a 0,8°C, principalmente devido a aerossóis [p.8]. O aquecimento proveniente dos GEE foi parcialmente mascarado pelo resfriamento por aerossóis [p.8][p.9].
* **Fatores naturais:** Fatores solares e vulcânicos alteraram a temperatura de superfície global em ±0,1°C [p.8]. Períodos quentes passados foram causados por lentas variações orbitais (multi-milenares) [p.9].
* **Variabilidade interna:** Alterou a temperatura de superfície global em ±0,2°C [p.8].

A influência humana é considerada o principal fator (""main driver""), responsável por mais de 50% da mudança, para vários outros fenômenos observados [p.12][p.13]:
* É extremamente provável que a influência humana seja o principal fator do aquecimento do oceano superior global (0-700m) desde a década de 1970 [p.12].
* A influência humana foi muito provavelmente o principal fator dos aumentos na taxa de elevação do nível do mar desde pelo menos 1971 [p.12].

Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver.

In the near term, natural variability149 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.876564660993763,0.8816825875581582,1.0,False

O aquecimento total é dominado pelas emissões cumulativas de CO2 passadas e futuras [p.26].

* Até 2019, o maior crescimento nas emissões brutas ocorreu no CO2 de combustíveis fósseis e indústria (CO2-FFI), seguido pelo CH4 [p.10].
* As emissões globais líquidas de GEE antropogênicos incluem CO2 da queima de combustíveis fósseis e processos industriais (CO2-FFI); CO2 líquido de uso da terra, mudança no uso da terra e florestas (CO2-LULUCF); CH4; N2O; e gases fluorados [p.9].
* Outros grandes contribuintes para o aquecimento são o ozônio troposférico (O3) e os gases halogenados [p.8].

É provável que os GEE bem misturados tenham contribuído com um aquecimento de 1,0°C a 2,0°C [p.8].

Global warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming decades.

This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.7096282631068503,0.4326562677045727,1.0,False

* É provável que os GEE bem misturados tenham contribuído com um aquecimento de 1,0°C a 2,0°C, enquanto outros fatores humanos (principalmente aerossóis) contribuíram com um resfriamento de 0,0°C a 0,8°C [p.8].
* Esses ""outros fatores humanos"" são predominantemente aerossóis de resfriamento, mas também incluem aerossóis de aquecimento, mudança no uso da terra (refletância do uso da terra) e ozônio [p.9].
* O efeito líquido de resfriamento que surge dos aerossóis antropogênicos atingiu seu pico no final do século XX (alta confiança) [p.8].

Em cenários futuros de baixas e muito baixas emissões de GEE (SSP1-1.9 e SSP1-2.6), as reduções nos aerossóis de resfriamento antropogênicos levam a um aquecimento líquido (alta confiança) [p.35].

change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related

2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2,

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

Observed Warming and its Causes Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.8634293406085574,0.5562247474691852,0.625,False

Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); net CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF) (green); CH4; N2O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) (light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed GHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and N2O is scaled', '69 Long-Term Climate and Development Futures Section 3 policies limit this additional warming and lead to strong benefits for air quality (high confidence). In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence). Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI Box TS.7} (Cross-Section Box.2) Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be', 'CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850-1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850-1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and attribution studies synthesise information', '44 Section 2 Section 1 Section 2 Average annual GHG emissions during 2010-2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1)69. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990.

While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5-11] GtCO2-eq yr-1 remain at the time of 134 Net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential.

The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55', 'CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C (67%) (Figure 3.5). Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO2) amount to about four-fifths131 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO2) and to about two-thirds132 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). {WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table 2.1} In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence).

If additional non-CO2 warming is higher, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood shrinks to around 300 GtCO2. If, however, additional non-CO2 warming is limited to only 0.05°C (via stronger reductions of CH4 and N2O through a combination of deep structural and behavioural changes, e.g., dietary changes), the RCB could be around 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C warming. {WGI Table SPM.2, WGI Box TS.7; WGIII Box 3.4} 130 When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, these RCB estimates are similar to SR1.5 but larger than AR5 values due to methodological improvements. {WGI SPM D.1.3} 131 Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the specific calculated fractions. 132 See footnote 131. 133 These projected adjustments of carbon sinks to stabilisation or decline of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are accounted for in calculations of remaining carbon budgets. {WGI SPM footnote 32} If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining', '93 Near-Term Responses in a Changing Climate Section 4 All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO2 emissions and non-CO2 emissions (see Figure 3.6) (high confidence). For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 (methane) emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040 (high confidence). Global CH4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020 (>67%) (high confidence). {WGIII SPM C1.2, WGIII Table SPM.2, WGIII 3.3; SR1.5 SPM C.1, SR1.5 SPM C.1.2} (Cross-Section Box.2) All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors (high confidence).

In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2', 'by WGI (see WGIII SPM Footnote 49). Negative values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent an increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53-58] GtCO2-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO2-eq (see 2.1.1). 4 Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Ranges in square brackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile 5-year interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach specific milestones over the 21st century. Percentiles reported across all pathways in that category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100. 5 For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO2-eq defined by the 100-year global warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate response and the assignment to a climate', 'non-CH4 ozone precursors. The high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) have CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively106. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have CO2 emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)107 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, impacts and risks. {WGI Box SPM.1} (Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1) In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways were categorised based on their projected global warming over the 21st century, with categories ranging from pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood108 with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways that exceed 4°C (C8). Methods to project global warming associated with the modelled pathways were updated to ensure consistency with the AR6 WGI', 'Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding CO2-LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70 (excluding CO2-LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita.

The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale (high confidence) (Figure 2.4). {WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.4.2, WG III TS.3} Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade (high confidence).

increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net 
anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel 
combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); 
net CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF) 
(green); CH4; N2O; and ﬂuorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) 
(light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed 
GHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their 
relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and

an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. 
The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from 
a 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 
1850–1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the 
estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest 
multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which 
occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial 
period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period 
was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century 
temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of 
the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused 
by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and 
attribution studies synthesise information from climate models 
and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the 
warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused 
by humans (panel (d)). The panel shows temperature change 
attributed to: total human inﬂuence; its decomposition into changes 
in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone 
and land-use change (land-use reﬂectance)); solar and volcanic

In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence). Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI Box TS.7} (Cross-Section Box.2) Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be', 'CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values).

Figure 2.1: The causal chain from emissions to resulting 
warming of the climate system. Emissions of GHG have 
increased rapidly over recent decades (panel (a)). Global net 
anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel 
combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) (dark green); 
net CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF) 
(green); CH4; N2O; and ﬂuorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) 
(light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric 
concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed 
GHGs CO2, CH4 and N2O (panel (b), annual values). To indicate their 
relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and 
N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, 
in the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts 
on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature 
change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019. This estimate arises from 
an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. 
The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from 
a 1850–1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 
1850–1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the 
estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest 
multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which 
occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial 
period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period 
was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century 
temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of 
the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused 
by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and 
attribution studies synthesise information from climate models 
and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the 
warming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused 
by humans (panel (d)). The panel shows temperature change 
attributed to: total human inﬂuence; its decomposition into changes 
in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone 
and land-use change (land-use reﬂectance)); solar and volcanic 
drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",8,54626,Roughly what fraction of human CO2 emissions is absorbed each year by land and ocean sinks?,"['CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C (67%) (Figure 3.5). Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 (2400 ±240 GtCO2) amount to about four-fifths131 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO2) and to about two-thirds132 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). {WGI Table SPM.2; WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Table 2.1} In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence).

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and

It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver.

Observed Warming and its Causes Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2010-201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C.

The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to -4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, WGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2} Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.

share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO2. This includes CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. 
CO2-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reﬂected by a global uncertainty estimate of ±70% (90% conﬁdence interval). Panel (b) shows the distribution of regional 
GHG emissions in tonnes CO2-eq per capita by region in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO2-FFI; net CO2-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, ﬂuorinated gases, 
expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles 
refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the 
axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions. Panel (c) shows global net anthropogenic GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2-eq yr–1 (GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 
1990–2019. Percentage values refer to the contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 1997 was due to 
higher CO2-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat ﬁre event in South East Asia. Regions are as grouped in Annex II of WGIII. Panel (d) shows population, gross domestic product 
(GDP) per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO2-FFI data, 
which is assessed in this report up to 2018. Consumption-based emissions are emissions released to the atmosphere in order to generate the goods and services consumed by a

2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI ",12,42034,Have marine heatwaves approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s?,"['region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3).

share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO2. This includes CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. 
CO2-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reﬂected by a global uncertainty estimate of ±70% (90% conﬁdence interval). Panel (b) shows the distribution of regional 
GHG emissions in tonnes CO2-eq per capita by region in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO2-FFI; net CO2-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, ﬂuorinated gases, 
expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles 
refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the 
axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions. Panel (c) shows global net anthropogenic GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2-eq yr–1 (GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 
1990–2019. Percentage values refer to the contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 1997 was due to 
higher CO2-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat ﬁre event in South East Asia. Regions are as grouped in Annex II of WGIII. Panel (d) shows population, gross domestic product 
(GDP) per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO2-FFI data,

2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI ",1.0,0.8565476675895813,0.0,0.42857142857142855,False

share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO2. This includes CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. 
CO2-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reﬂected by a global uncertainty estimate of ±70% (90% conﬁdence interval). Panel (b) shows the distribution of regional 
GHG emissions in tonnes CO2-eq per capita by region in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO2-FFI; net CO2-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, ﬂuorinated gases, 
expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles 
refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the 
axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions. Panel (c) shows global net anthropogenic GHG emissions by region (in GtCO2-eq yr–1 (GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 
1990–2019. Percentage values refer to the contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 1997 was due to 
higher CO2-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat ﬁre event in South East Asia. Regions are as grouped in Annex II of WGIII. Panel (d) shows population, gross domestic product 
(GDP) per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO2-FFI data, 
which is assessed in this report up to 2018. Consumption-based emissions are emissions released to the atmosphere in order to generate the goods and services consumed by a

2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI ",12,46119,By how much did global mean sea level rise between 1901 and 2018?,"['m between 1901 and 2018.

expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles 
refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the

2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI ",1.0,0.8580684411236644,0.5773681593114709,0.375,False

Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1).

It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver.

Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4).

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",8,55099,"Since 1970, has surface warming increased faster than any other 50-year period in 2000 years?","['63 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.

In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards (medium to high confidence, depending on region and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans (very high confidence). In the near term, natural variability149 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850-1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence).

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.803771820457322,0.45094952581173636,1.0,False

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around

Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.9018370108726456,0.5425621340593735,0.9523809523809523,False

Apesar da taxa de crescimento mais lenta, as emissões médias anuais de GEE durante 2010-2019 foram mais altas do que em qualquer década anterior [p.10].

O crescimento médio anual das emissões de GEE entre 2010 e 2019 desacelerou em comparação com a década anterior no fornecimento de energia (de 2,3% para 1,0%) e na indústria (de 3,4% para 1,4%), mas permaneceu aproximadamente constante em cerca de 2% yr-1 no setor de transportes (alta confiança) [p.10].

Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990.

About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation (medium confidence). Land overall constituted a net sink of -6.6 (±4.6) GtCO2 yr-1 for the period 2010-201972 (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM B.2, WGIII SPM B.2.1, WGIII SPM B.2.2, WGIII TS 5.6.1} Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production.

The 10% of', 'While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr-1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon intensity (CO2-FFI per unit primary energy) also decreased by 0.3% yr-1, mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions (high confidence). At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and consumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than 10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure (high confidence). Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates of around 4% yr-1 for several years consecutively (high confidence).

(high confidence) {WGIII SPM B.3, WGIII SPM B3.1, WGIII SPM B.3.2, WGIII SPM B.3.3} Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors (high confidence). In 2019, approximately 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO2-eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-eq) from buildings71 (high confidence).

In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence).

In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence).

occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% 
between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic 
GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, 
about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions 
occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by

ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2).

have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, 
respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding 
CO2-LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries 
emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global 
population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70

The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C - if no additional commitments are made or actions taken (Figure 2.5, Table 2.2). A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C (>67%), assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission', 'likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2} Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities.

Negative values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent an increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53-58] GtCO2-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO2-eq (see 2.1.1). 4 Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways.

In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence). Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI Box TS.7} (Cross-Section Box.2) Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be', 'and metric-weighted98 non-CO2 GHG emissions to be counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals (high confidence).

The potential and cost of achieving net zero or even net negative emissions vary by sector and region. If and when net zero emissions for a given sector or region are reached depends on multiple factors, including the potential to reduce GHG emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal, the associated costs, and the availability of policy mechanisms to balance emissions and removals between sectors and countries.

By 2020, over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions (medium confidence). Equity and distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support low-income households, among other approaches (high confidence). The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale (high confidence) (Figure 2.4). {WGIII SPM B.4.1, WGIII SPM B.5.2, WGIII SPM E.4.2, WG III TS.3} Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade (high confidence). While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr-1', 'in cities.

In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), air pollution control policies, reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming (high confidence). Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.1.7, WGI Box TS.7} (Cross-Section Box.2) Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be', 'and metric-weighted98 non-CO2 GHG emissions to be counterbalanced by durably stored CO2 removals (high confidence).

Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher

2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 
and 2009 (2.1% yr-1)69. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 
1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) 
occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% 
between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic 
GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, 
about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions 
occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by 
CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated

vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also 
in terms of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net 
CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations 
in regional and national per capita emissions partly reﬂect different 
development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income 
levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 
ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). 
Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) 
have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, 
respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding 
CO2-LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries 
emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global 
population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70 
(excluding CO2-LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less

The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including 
solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently 
since 2010 (Figure 2.4). Design and process innovations in 
combination with the use of digital technologies have led to 
near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions 
options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, 
there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy 
(by 85%), wind energy (by 55%), and lithium-ion batteries (by 85%), 
and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for 
electric vehicles (EVs), albeit varying widely across regions (Figure 2.4). 
Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from 
fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly 
competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale 
battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In 
comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical 
record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with 
fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions 
and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive

Observed Warming and its Causes Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2010-201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C.

Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1', 'm between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to -4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}

For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",8,52148,What was the global surface temperature in 2001–2020 relative to 1850–1900?,"['63 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.

Relative to 1995-2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2050 is between 0.15 to 0.23 m in the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and 0.20 to 0.29 m in the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); by 2100 between 0.28 to 0.55 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.63 to 1.01 m under SSP5-8.5; and by 2150 between 0.37 to 0.86 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.98 to 1.88 m under SSP5-8.5 (medium confidence). Changes relative to 1900 are calculated by adding 0.158 m (observed global mean sea level rise from 1900 to 1995-2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995-2014. The future changes to 2300', 'Climate System Changes and Impacts to Date It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1', 'm between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to -4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.1.5, WGI SPM A.1.6, WG1 SPM A1.7, WGI SPM A.2, WG1.SPM A.4.2; SROCC SPM.A.1, SROCC SPM A.2} Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",0.6,0.8599982712759874,0.5430205883081884,1.0,False

Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900.

This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity.

The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is

Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3). It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-caused climate change is the main driver of these changes.

The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-caused climate change is likely the main driver (Figure 2.3). Human-caused climate change has contributed to increases in', 'Climate System Changes and Impacts to Date It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018.

To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850-1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850-1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade.

Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4).

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.6818315949824804,0.4541847041771344,0.8,False
