2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases

warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2,

advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5

The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations.

Panel (a) shows the share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO2. This includes CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. CO2-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reflected by a global uncertainty estimate of ±70% (90% confidence interval). Panel (b) shows the distribution of regional GHG emissions in tonnes CO2-eq per capita by region in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO2-FFI; net CO2-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, fluorinated gases, expressed in CO2-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO2-LULUCF is below the axis, indicating net CO2 removals rather than emissions.

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.5724722146944249,0.32499999998375,0.46153846153846156

Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018.

2.1.2. Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to 
Date
It is unequivocal that human inﬂuence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in 
the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 
(Table 2.1). The scale of recent changes across the climate system as 
a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system 
are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It 
is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric 
warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone 
depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 
and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 
(0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that 
human inﬂuence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 
91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss 
and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, 
respectively (high conﬁdence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level 
rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 
1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing 
to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 (high conﬁdence). 
Human inﬂuence was very likely the main driver of these increases 
since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human inﬂuence is very likely the main 
driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease 
in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human 
inﬂuence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is 
virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver 
of current global acidiﬁcation of the surface open ocean. {WGI ",0.4,0.8687169747587552,0.0,0.0

Many changes from past and future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales, particularly for global sea level [p.35]. Sea level rise is projected to continue for thousands of years (high confidence) [p.34]. Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level is projected to rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C, and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C [p.43].

Global mean sea level will continue to increase in the 21st century at rates that are dependent on future emissions (virtually certain) [p.35].

This dependence is illustrated by projections for different emissions scenarios [p.47]:

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over 
63 
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.9511037689446621,0.9166666666361111,0.6153846153846154

Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2.

than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 
2010 and 2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 
and 2009 (2.1% yr-1)69. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 
1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) 
occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% 
between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic 
GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, 
about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions 
occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by 
CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated 
gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. (high confidence) 
{WGIII SPM B1.1, WGIII SPM B.1.2, WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Figure SPM.1, 
WGIII Figure SPM.2}
Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions 
continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions 
vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also 
in terms of contributions to CO2-FFI (1650 ± 73 GtCO2-eq) and net 
CO2-LULUCF (760 ± 220 GtCO2-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations 
in regional and national per capita emissions partly reﬂect different 
development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income 
levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 
ranged from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). 
Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) 
have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, 
respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), excluding 
CO2-LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries 
emitting on average more than 6 tCO2-eq per capita, 35% of the global 
population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita70 
(excluding CO2-LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less 
than 3 tCO2-eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these 
low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. (high conﬁdence)
{WGIII SPM B.3, WGIII SPM B3.1, WGIII SPM B.3.2, WGIII SPM B.3.3}
Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major 
sectors (high conﬁdence). In 2019, approximately 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) 
of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% 
(14 GtCO2-eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% 
(8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-eq) from buildings71

GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different GHGs in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq) using 
the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports 
contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of 
metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate 
system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.8, WGI 7.6; WGIII SPM B.1, WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 2.2} (Annex I: Glossary)

policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or 
behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban 
areas combined with electriﬁcation and renewable energy can create 
health co-beneﬁts from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility (high 
conﬁdence). Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an 
overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across 
policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the 
context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances 
regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the 
context to mobilise ﬁnance (medium conﬁdence). These functions can 
be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or 
climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national 
context (medium conﬁdence). Effective and equitable climate 
governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political 
actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local 
communities (medium conﬁdence). {WGIII SPM E.2.2, WGIII SPM E.3,

The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including 
solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently 
since 2010 (Figure 2.4). Design and process innovations in 
combination with the use of digital technologies have led to 
near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions 
options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, 
there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy 
(by 85%), wind energy (by 55%), and lithium-ion batteries (by 85%), 
and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for 
electric vehicles (EVs), albeit varying widely across regions (Figure 2.4). 
Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from 
fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly 
competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale 
battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In 
comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical 
record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with 
fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions 
and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive 
systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than 
transitioning to low emission systems. (high conﬁdence) {WGIII SPM B.4,

For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and 
chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are 
at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage 
but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design 
in construction and retroﬁt of buildings has led to increasing examples 
of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation 
made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital 
technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and 
artiﬁcial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; 
they can increase energy efﬁciency, and promote the adoption of many 
low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, 
while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate 
change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in 
demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several 
mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electriﬁcation of 
urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efﬁciency, demand

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic. (See Annex I: Glossary)
64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI.

Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO2-eq in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry (CO2-FFI) followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. (high confidence) {WGIII SPM B1.1, WGIII SPM B.1.2, WGIII SPM B.1.3, WGIII Figure SPM.1, WGIII Figure SPM.2} Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely.

Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019.

Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2 [p.10].

This human influence is the driver for observed changes [p.9]. It is *likely* that well-mixed GHGs contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C [p.8]. Furthermore, it is *virtually certain* that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean [p.12].

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",0.8888888888888888,0.6221847289187644,0.9999999999,0.46153846153846156
