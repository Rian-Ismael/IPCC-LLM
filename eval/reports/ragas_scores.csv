Observed Warming and its Causes Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850-1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850-1900 to 2010-201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C.

Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010-2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high confidence). Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages63 to nature and people (high confidence).

To indicate their relative importance each subpanel’s vertical extent for CO2, CH4 and N2O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH4 indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850-1900 to 2010-2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850-1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1°C since 1850-1900 (panel (c)). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5°C to 1.5°C] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and attribution studies synthesise information', '98 Section 4 Section 1 Section 4 Global warming will continue to increase in the near term (2021-2040) mainly due to increased cumulative CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards (medium to high confidence, depending on region and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans (very high confidence). In the near term, natural variability149 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850-1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence).

It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver74 of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1', 'rises from 1.5°C to 3°C (medium confidence). Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without adaptation (medium confidence). {WGII SPM B.4.1, WGII SPM B.4.2, WGII Figure SPM.3, WGII TS Appendix AII, WGII Appendix I Global to Regional Atlas Figure AI.46} (Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3) Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems (high confidence). Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species (medium confidence) and biome shifts across 35% of global land area (medium confidence). At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people (medium confidence) and about 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity (medium confidence). At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the fire frequency by ~30% compared to today (medium confidence). {WGII', '83 Long-Term Climate and Development Futures Section 3 0 1000 500 1500 2000 2020 a) Carbon budgets and emissions Lifetime emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement, if historical operating patterns are maintained 2020-2030 CO2 emissions assuming constant at 2019 level 1.5°C (>50% chance) 2°C (83% chance) 2°C (>67% chance) Existing Existing and planned Historical emissions 1850-2019 2°C (83%) 1.5°C (>50%) Carbon budgets 1000 0 2000 Remaining carbon budgets diﬀerent emissions scenarios and their ranges of warming Remaining carbon budgets to limit warming to 1.5°C could soon be exhausted, and those for 2°C largely depleted Remaining carbon budgets are similar to emissions from use of existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure, without additional abatement these emissions determine how much warming we will experience Warming since 1850-1900 °C Cumulative CO2 emissions (GtCO2) since 1850 Historical global warming SSP1-1.9 SSP1-2.6 SSP2-4.5 SSP3-7.0 SSP5-8.5 1000 2000 3000 4000 4500 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 historical since 2020 Cumulative CO2 emissions (GtCO2) this line indicates maximum emissions to stay within 2°C of warming (with 83% chance) Every']","Global surface temperature in 2011–2020 was around 1.1°C above the 1850–1900 level [p.8][p.9][p.36].

2.1 Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, 
with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions 
have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production 
across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (high conﬁdence). Human-caused climate 
change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to 
widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related 
losses and damages63 to nature and people (high conﬁdence). Vulnerable communities who have historically 
contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (high conﬁdence).

Section 2: Current Status and Trends
2.1.1. Observed Warming and its Causes
Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 
2011–2020 (1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C)64, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean 
(0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C)65. Observed warming is human-caused, with 
warming from greenhouse gases (GHG), dominated by CO2 and 
methane (CH4), partly masked by aerosol cooling (Figure 2.1). 
Global surface temperature in the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century 
(2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global 
surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 
50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high conﬁdence). The 
likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase 
from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate 
of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs67 contributed a warming 
of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) 
contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural (solar and volcanic) 
drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal 
variability changed it by ±0.2°C. {WGI SPM A.1, WGI SPM A.1.2, 
WGI SPM A.1.3, WGI SPM A.2.2, WGI Figure SPM.2; SRCCL TS.2}
Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 
1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. 
Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion 
(globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over

64 
The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C). Additionally, methodological 
advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements 
have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 
{WGI SPM A1.2 and footnote 10}
65 
For 1850–1900 to 2013–2022 the updated calculations are 1.15 [1.00 to 1.25]°C for global surface temperature, 1.65 [1.36 to 1.90]°C for land temperatures and 
0.93 [0.73 to 1.04]°C for ocean temperatures above 1850–1900 using the exact same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI. 
66 
The period distinction with the observed assessment arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C. {WG",1.0,0.9072474626712511,0.6820673076837819,1.0
