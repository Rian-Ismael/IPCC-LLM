The vertical bar on the right shows the \nestimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest \nmulti-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which \noccurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial \nperiod (Holocene).

These past warm periods were caused \nby slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and \nattribution studies synthesise information from climate models \nand observations and show that the best estimate is that all the \nwarming observed between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is caused \nby humans (panel (d)).
